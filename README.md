Avalon Gen2 Hasher
------------------

This project contains a circuit board, firmware and cgminer/bfgminer patch to get the new Avalon Gen2 ASICs (A3255Q48) hashing.

**Board features:**

  - Very efficient (~90%) DC/DC converter to power the ASICs
  - Adjustable voltage (0.85 - 1.25 V) to choose between efficiency and overclocking
  - USB-Interface to connect to a host running cgminer or bfgminer
  - TWI interface to chain multiple boards together
  - 100% flat surface on the bottom side to mount a usual heatsink
  - On-board temperature management
  - Fan connector with rotation speed measurement and PWM-control
  - Indicator LED to report USB-activity
  - 4-layer PCB for optimal heat/current transportation
  - Two board designs available: one for 10 and another for 16 ASICs

**cgminer/bfgminer patch features:**

  - Reporting temperature, real ASIC frequency and fan-speed back to the host
  - Control of ASIC frequency in a big range from 62.5 to 5000 MHz in smallest possible steps
  - Control of a desired temperature

**Get a board:**

I can offer bare pcb's and ready-to-mine units. But first i have to see how much demand here is, to get an idea of how many boards i should order - which is turning the screw of pricing.

If you want to order a board, send me a message with the following information:
- ammount of bare PCBs you want
- ammount of ready-to-mine boards you want
- destination country

At december 8th i will make a summary, get prices at the distributors, pcb-fab and assy and will reply to your mails with an offer you can't refuse.

Be aware that i don't sell Avalon chips. If you want an assembled board, you have to supply the chips on tape or reel to me in germany.
